      <description>Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (known as the &amp;ldquo;ELK&amp;rdquo; stack) provide the ability to visualize data from any source. This is a follow up to my previous Logstash post. This is updated with the latest versions of the components and &amp;ldquo;dockerized&amp;rdquo; for easy use and deployment.
Elasticsearch Elasticsearch is a distributed, real-time, indexed datastore. It uses Lucene at its core to provide full text search functionality. It is schema free meaning you can throw any type of data at it.</description>

      <title>Docker Private Registry</title>

      <description>One of the best features in Docker is the ability to build and share images. The public Docker index is a great place to find and share images. However, if you want to have a private registry that is in your control (inside the firewall, etc.) this is where the Docker Registry shines.
The Docker Registry is an application that powers the public index. The Docker team has put a lot of work into making it easy to run a standalone registry.</description>
